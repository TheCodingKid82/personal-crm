# HEARTBEAT.md - Agent Factory Status

## ✅ Core Build Complete (4:30 AM EST)
The Agent Factory system is built and E2E tested.
Full plan and status: `memory/agent-factory-plan.md`

### Remaining Tasks (non-blocking):
- Commit all changes to git
- Consider deploying dashboard to Railway
- P8 (real email/Whop) needs Andrew's input on providers

### If context compacted:
Read `memory/agent-factory-plan.md` and `SESSION.md` for full status.
The work is DONE unless Andrew requests changes.
