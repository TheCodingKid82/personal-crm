## 🔄 CVR OPTIMIZATION LOOP - ACTIVE

**Goal:** Achieve 50% CVR through automated iteration
**Status:** Running iteration 1
**State file:** `memory/cvr-loop-state.json`

### Loop Process:
1. Run CVR agents (5 simulated users)
2. Collect conversion rate + feedback
3. Edit announcements app code based on recommendations
4. Redeploy to CVR-Loop environment
5. Repeat until CVR >= 50%

## CVR-Loop Database Setup

Set up the announcements app database in the **CVR-Loop Railway environment** (separate from production).

### Database Connection
- **Environment**: CVR-Loop (Railway)
- **DATABASE_URL**: `postgresql://supabase_admin:fayb11cm3d1gqmozig7m9kfqvff0am2vz0oytx7g4ywld2d23g34yorhs6552ysb@tramway.proxy.rlwy.net:16374/postgres`

### Tables Created
Ran migrations to create announcements app schema:
- `announcements` - Main announcement posts
- `reactions` - User emoji reactions (👍, 🔥, 🐐, 💯)
- `notification_settings` - User notification preferences per experience
- `views` - Tracks announcement views

### Migration Script
Created `run-migrations.mjs` in announcements-whop-app directory using `postgres` package (since psql not installed locally).

### App Status
- CVR-Loop app URL: https://announcements-whop-app-cvr-loop.up.railway.app
- Dev bypass: `/api/dev-bypass` redirects to test experience
- App now loads properly after migrations ✅

### Next Step
Ready to run CVR simulation against the CVR-Loop environment.
