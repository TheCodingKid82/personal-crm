## Chapter 1: The Beginning (February 2025)

**February 27, 2025** — the first day.

Andrew was still in school. Cale reached out, and at 3:37 PM they hopped on their first call — 21 minutes that would set everything in motion.

By that evening, they were already deep in product talk:

> **Cale (5:40 PM):** "yo, we're gonna do strictly functionality tonight—we can already adjust design later and I think it's at a good point rn (front page) just make sure the design is cleaned up and keep making the response UI. Tonight we'll add models, both work on response and really make the product itself better."

Andrew couldn't work that night — a family friend was staying over. But the tone was set: these two were going to build things together.

**32 messages** that month. A spark.

## Chapter 2: Finding Their Footing (March - April 2025)

**March** brought **1,587 messages** and the grind began. They were "backtesting" something — likely a trading or finance tool. Working with others, coordinating handoffs: *"Awesome mate, I'll get back to you tomorrow."*

**April** exploded to **3,364 messages** — their most intense early month.

This was the **Trading Era**. Charts flying back and forth. Stock tickers. Quick calls:

> **Andrew:** "COP - SHORT - OK"

Hour-long calls became normal. They were learning together — not just how to build, but how to read markets, how to move fast, how to trust each other's judgment.

## Chapter 3: Pivot to Growth (May - June 2025)

By **May** (**2,431 messages**), the energy shifted from trading to product growth.

> **Cale:** "the ideas are just flowing"

They started thinking about monetization differently — affiliate links, integrations, Cal.com scheduling built into their products. The sidebar strategy. Distribution over pure product.

**June** (**2,717 messages**) crystallized the partnership dynamic:

> **Andrew:** "You focus on building the best app you can, and we will handle getting you customers."

This wasn't just a co-founder relationship anymore. They were dividing labor: Cale builds, Andrew sells. Analytics dashboards appeared. They were tracking real metrics now.

## Chapter 4: Hitting Walls (July - August 2025)

**July** (**3,182 messages**) brought challenges.

Email collection wasn't working:
> **Cale:** "U able to grab emails?"
> **Andrew:** "No, for some reason it's quite a challenge"

But they kept networking. Cale shared **Consumer Club** — a community of 300+ consumer app founders. They were learning from others, positioning themselves.

**August** (**2,320 messages**) hit infrastructure problems. Their project **Osis** had Supabase issues:

> **Cale:** "I think osis supabase got paised"
> **Cale:** "They do this shit to save $"

Some days were quiet — August 25th had zero messages. Not every day was a sprint. Sometimes you just need to put your head down and fix things.

By late August, they were back at it, reviewing designs:
> **Andrew:** "Looking much better!"

Client work was picking up. Figma handoffs. Revenue conversations. The long game:
> **Cale:** "long term game... especially since if they like us they'll give us more shit"

---

## Chapter 5: First Real Traction (September 2025)

**September** (**3,189 messages**) changed everything.

Something clicked. The numbers started moving:

> **Cale:** "I mean we went from 0 to this in 5 weeks at most"
> **Cale:** "all in, 4 weeks"

They debated going public with it:
> **Cale:** "do u think it's weird to make like a x post with our MRR / how much we're killing it?"
> **Cale:** "I don't want to make it feel like an insane achievement since real goal is 100 but still would be cool"

**Real goal is 100.** That number would grow.

This was the moment the partnership graduated from "project" to "company."

## Chapter 6: Going Big (October 2025)

**October** was the **biggest month** — **5,909 messages**.

They were everywhere. CustomGPT. Go AI. Multiple products, multiple bets.

Then the realization:
> **Andrew:** "Oh shit I just realized we took equity of directly competing apps"

They weren't just building anymore. They were taking **equity positions** in other people's products. The agency model was evolving — build for equity, not just cash.

Travel happened. Calls with parents. Real business conversations:
> **Cale:** "Let me talk to my dad"

The stakes were getting higher.

## Chapter 7: The Whop Era (November - December 2025)

**November** (**2,865 messages**) saw a strategic pivot: **Whop**.

They went all-in on the Whop ecosystem:
- Whop App Marketing Accelerator
- Building multiple Whop apps
- **Announcements** (letting Whop owners message their users)
- Client work with real structure

> **Cale:** "Jordan's requested next steps: Get a base data structure in place so each product tab can be finalized"

This wasn't scrappy anymore. PRDs. Milestones. Accountability.

**December** (**814 messages**) — the holiday slowdown. But the fire didn't go out:

> **Cale:** "If we just iterate this features section alone, ez 2x MRR. Let's cook"
> **Cale:** "I think this'll do some damage ngl"

And then, the number that would define 2026:
> **Cale:** "pro tip: never use auto. i gotta pay tmr for something cause this thing gonna make me hang myself before we hit **100kmrr**"

**$100k MRR** — the new north star.

## Chapter 8: The AI Era Begins (January 2026)

**January 2026** opened with momentum. **622+ messages** and counting.

Agency deals were closing:
- $3k contract signature solution
- Revenue share agreements being drafted
- Cale reviewing contracts: *"I want to make sure we don't get burnt"*

The **Funnels app** was in development — AI-powered ClickFunnels competitor.

But the real game-changer hit on **January 25, 2026**.

Andrew discovered **ClawdBot**. The excitement was immediate:

> **Cale:** "this thing is insane holy"
> **Cale:** "pov: u do $100k/m talking to clawd on phone"
> **Cale:** "let it do everything"
> **Cale:** "website"
> **Cale:** "outreach"

The vision crystallized:
> **"5 companies in 1 week with ClawdBot"**

Andrew bought a **Mac Mini M3** to run AI automation 24/7.

The plan: let AI handle coding, communications, operations. Free up Andrew to be the CEO — strategy, deals, capital allocation.

## The Partnership Today

**Cale's Discord status:** *"be delusional till it's real"*

**Andrew's vision:** Turn Spark Studio into the **AI version of Berkshire Hathaway** — acquire and hold businesses, let them compound, all managed by AI.

**The numbers:**
- 11 months of building
- 20,718+ messages
- Multiple products (Announcements, Funnels, Travel Agency Platform, AI Funnel Builder)
- Equity positions in multiple apps
- Active MRR with retention balancing churn
- Goal: **$100k MRR**

**The dynamic:**
- Andrew: Strategy, sales, capital allocation, vision
- Cale: Building, product, execution, design

**The tension that keeps it real:**
> **Andrew:** "It's been months since you've brought in some revenue"

They push each other. That's why it works.

## What Comes Next

January 2026 marks the beginning of a new chapter. With ClawdBot handling the operational load, the question isn't "can we build it?" anymore.

It's "how fast can we scale?"

The answer: **5 companies in 1 week.**

From a 21-minute call in February 2025 to AI-powered empire building in January 2026 — that's the Andrew and Cale story.

And it's just getting started.
