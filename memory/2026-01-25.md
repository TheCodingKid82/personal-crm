## Voice Message Transcription Setup
- Enabled audio transcription for Telegram voice messages
- OpenAI Whisper failed (account has no credits)
- Configured **Groq Whisper** (whisper-large-v3-turbo) — working great

## Deep Dive with Andrew
Andrew shared detailed context via voice note:

### Current Focus
- **#1 Priority:** Increase MRR at Announcements app
- Currently at ~$7k MRR with many free trials pending conversion
- Strategy: Use AI agents to iteratively test and improve conversion rate

### Three Active Products
1. **Announcements** - Whop app, selling to sports betting/trading/clipping users
2. **Booked.Travel** - Travel platform for Insider Expeditions, will expand to other agencies
3. **Funnels** - Cale building AI funnel maker

### My Responsibilities
- Handle Matt's requests from Insider Expeditions Slack channel
- Fix bugs and VERIFY fixes work on the site
- Eventually manage more of Announcements app
- Alert Andrew only on urgent/bad/problem situations
- Otherwise: just handle it autonomously

### Andrew's Schedule
- Night owl: sleeps ~5am, wakes 10am-3pm
- Lives between NYC and Florida
- Works constantly unless with family
- Can contact anytime

### Vision
"We need to be the number one company in the world. The biggest holding company in the world. Powered by AI. And you are going to be able to run this company."

## Insider Expeditions Slack Check (insiderexpediton-x-whop channel)
Accessed via browser automation. Found several outstanding issues from Matt Billington:

### Active Issues (Jan 23rd)
1. **Itinerary page broken** - Antarctica page (`booked.travel/t/antarctica-november-2026`) showing all black, days disappeared
2. **Discounts not working** - Can't create/activate/deactivate promo codes
   - Error: `Expected "fixed" to be one of: percentage, flat_amount`
   - Specific code affected: `MASTERCOMPINSIDER`
3. **Finance page** - Data not flowing correctly, Matt wants call to discuss

### Older Issues (Jan 21-22)
4. **Inventory bug** (URGENT) - Stars over Fiji showing 4 Hibiscus cabins available when sold out
5. **Booking glitch** - Stan's payment processed but booking didn't show on frontend
   - Andrew added booking details to payment metadata as fix

### Important Note from Matt
> "Don't make any changes [the team] requests until we've had time to review the requested changes together"

Channel members: Matt Billington, Nicholas Hibbler, Cale Lane, Hunter Dickinson + Andrew

## Railway Deployment Fix
- Found failed Railway deployment (43 mins old) - missing `getResourceUsageStats` export
- Error: `app/api/resources/route.ts` importing function that didn't exist in `resources-store.ts`
- Fixed: Added `getResourceUsageStats` function to `lib/data/resources-store.ts`
- Pushed fix to GitHub, deployment building on Railway

## Workflow Learned
1. **Check Railway for deployment status** before/after code changes
2. **Repos are already local** at `C:\Users\theul\Desktop\Osis\*`
3. **Don't ask permission** for small fixes - just do them
4. Build locally with `pnpm run build` to verify before pushing

## TODO
- [x] Check Slack for Insider Expeditions channel / Matt's requests
- [x] Fix itinerary page (Antarctica) - ~~text visibility + days display~~ (Andrew confirmed fixed)
- [x] Fix discounts system - ~~promoType validation issue~~ (Andrew confirmed fixed)
- [x] Review finance page data flow (Andrew confirmed fixed)
- [x] Fix Railway build error (getResourceUsageStats missing export)
- [ ] Verify Railway deployment succeeds
