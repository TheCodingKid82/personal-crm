## App Split Architecture Decision

**Problem:** Users churning from Announcements app - confused by multi-purpose app, don't know how to use features.

**Solution:** Split into 3 standalone Whop apps:
1. **Clipping AI** (Viral Clipping)
2. **Sports Betting AI** 
3. **Trading AI**

**Implementation:**
- Create 3 new apps in Whop dashboard
- Create 3 new repos (based on announcements-whop-app template)
- Each repo gets its own API key + App ID
- List all 3 in Vertigo Whop storefront
- Feature Pack & Viral Clipping AI products grant access
- Each app internally verifies user has required product access

**Status:** ✅ Complete — All 3 Whop apps created, all 3 repos scaffolded by background agents

**Next Steps:**
1. `pnpm install` in each repo
2. Configure `.env.local` with full API keys
3. Set up databases (Drizzle push)
4. Deploy to Railway (3 separate deployments)
5. Add apps to Vertigo Whop storefront
6. Wire up Feature Pack / Viral Clipping products to grant access

## Evening Session (8-10:30 PM)

### Duet Refund Request
- Andrew wants refund from Duet (screen sharing software)
- Found support email: **legal@duetdisplay.com**
- Opened Outlook (andreweir@weirtech.net) in browser - waiting for Andrew's password
- Draft email ready for refund request

### Clawdbot Updates
- Updated Clawdbot via npm: 2026.1.23-1 → **2026.1.24-3**
- Created cron job: **8 AM daily** auto-update check

### Memory System Overhaul
Andrew requested better memory - I was forgetting context between sessions.

**New structure:**
- `SESSION.md` - Working memory handoff (READ FIRST every session)
- `memory/projects/insider-expeditions.md` - Project-specific context
- `memory/projects/announcements-app.md` - Project-specific context
- Updated `AGENTS.md` with new workflow

**Key insight:** Need short-term handoff (SESSION.md), not just long-term (MEMORY.md)

### OpenAI API Key for memory_search
- Created new OpenAI API key: "Clawdbot-Memory"
- Added to Clawdbot config via gateway config.apply
- memory_search now connects to OpenAI ✅
- **BUT:** Indexing fails - OpenAI batch API is extremely slow, times out
- Grep fallback works perfectly for lookups

### Memory Search Status
- Provider: openai (text-embedding-3-small)
- Indexed: 0/10 files (batch API keeps timing out)
- Workaround: Use grep/Select-String to search memory files
