## 🏆 Tips for Getting a 5

### Content Mastery
1. **Focus on CAUSES and EFFECTS** - The exam loves causation
2. **Know your COMPARISONS** - Similar processes across regions
3. **Master CONTINUITY & CHANGE** - What stayed the same? What changed?
4. **Connect across time periods** - How did X in 1200 lead to Y in 1750?

### The 6 Themes Are Your Framework
Every question connects to at least one theme. When stuck:
- Ask: "Which theme is this about?"
- Use theme vocabulary in your essays

### MCQ Strategy
- Read the question FIRST, then the stimulus
- Eliminate obviously wrong answers
- Look for the BEST answer, not just a correct one
- Don't overthink - your first instinct is usually right

### Free Response Gold
**SAQ (Short Answer)**
- Answer the question directly - no fluff
- A-B-C format, clear and labeled
- Specific examples with dates

**LEQ (Long Essay)**
- Strong thesis with clear argument
- Contextualization in intro (2-3 sentences of background)
- 2-3 body paragraphs with specific evidence
- Analysis > Description

**DBQ (Document-Based)**
- Use ALL or ALL BUT ONE documents
- HIPP at least 2 documents (Historical context, Intended audience, Purpose, Point of view)
- Include outside evidence (1 specific example not in docs)
- Make an argument, don't just summarize docs

### Test Day Tips
- Eat breakfast, bring snacks
- Read questions carefully - they tell you exactly what to do
- Budget time: Don't spend too long on one question
- Write something for every question - partial credit exists
