## The Columbian Exchange

### From Americas to Afro-Eurasia
| Category | Items | Impact |
|----------|-------|--------|
| **Crops** | Potatoes, maize, tomatoes, cacao, tobacco | Population growth in Europe, Africa, Asia |
| **Animals** | Turkeys, llamas | Limited impact |
| **Diseases** | Syphilis (possibly) | Minor compared to reverse |

| Category | Items | Impact |
|----------|-------|--------|
| **Crops** | Wheat, rice, sugarcane, coffee | Plantation economy |
| **Animals** | Horses, cattle, pigs, sheep | Transformed Native life, ranching |

## Colonial Systems

### Spanish Empire
- **Encomienda**: Forced labor system, natives worked for colonists
- **Hacienda**: Large agricultural estates
- **Mita**: Adapted Inca labor system for silver mining
- **Viceroyalties**: Administrative divisions
- **Silver**: Potosí (Bolivia) and Mexican mines fueled global trade

### Portuguese Empire
- **Factory system**: Coastal trading posts, not territorial control
- **Brazil**: Sugar plantations, African slave labor
- **Indian Ocean**: Controlled trade through naval power

### British and French Colonies
- Settlement colonies in North America
- Less indigenous labor, more settler farming
- Plantation economy in Caribbean

### Dutch Empire
- **Dutch East India Company (VOC)**: First multinational corporation
- Focus on trade, especially spices
- Replaced Portuguese in Southeast Asia

## The Atlantic Slave Trade

### Triangle Trade
1. **Europe → Africa**: Manufactured goods, guns, textiles
2. **Africa → Americas**: Enslaved Africans (Middle Passage)
3. **Americas → Europe**: Sugar, tobacco, cotton, silver

### Scale and Impact
- ~12 million Africans forcibly transported
- ~2 million died during Middle Passage
- African societies disrupted
- Plantation economies dependent on slave labor
- Racial hierarchy established

### African Participation
- African kingdoms sold war captives
- Some states grew wealthy (Dahomey, Asante)
- Increased warfare to capture slaves

## Cause and Effect Relationships

### European Exploration
**Causes:**
- Ottoman control of Eastern trade routes
- Renaissance curiosity and ambition
- Technological advances (ships, navigation)
- Competition between European states
- Religious zeal (spread Christianity)

**Effects:**
- Columbian Exchange
- Decline of indigenous American populations
- Rise of Atlantic slave trade
- Global trade networks
- European colonial empires

### Silver Trade
