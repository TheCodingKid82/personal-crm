# Unit 6: Consequences of Industrialization (1750-1900)

## Overview
This unit examines how industrialization transformed economies, societies, and global power dynamics. Key focus: How did industrialization change the world?

---

## Key Concepts

### 6.1 The Industrial Revolution Begins
- Started in **Britain** (~1750-1850)
- Shift from hand production to machine manufacturing
- Factory system replaces cottage industry
- New energy sources: coal, steam

### 6.2 Why Britain First?
- **Capital**: Wealth from trade and colonies
- **Resources**: Coal and iron deposits
- **Labor**: Agricultural revolution freed workers
- **Geography**: Rivers, ports, compact size
- **Government**: Stable, protected property rights
- **Culture**: Scientific inquiry, entrepreneurship

### 6.3 Spread of Industrialization
- Belgium, France, Germany (1800s)
- United States (especially after 1860)
- Japan (Meiji era, 1868+)
- Russia (late 1800s, more so 1900s)

## Key Innovations

| Innovation | Inventor | Significance |
|------------|----------|--------------|
| **Spinning jenny** | James Hargreaves | Faster textile production |
| **Water frame** | Richard Arkwright | Water-powered spinning |
| **Steam engine** | James Watt (improved) | Powered factories, transportation |

## Effects on Society

### Urbanization
- Mass migration from countryside to cities
- Rapid, unplanned city growth
- Overcrowding, disease, pollution
- By 1900: Most Britons lived in cities

### Working Conditions
- 14-16 hour workdays
- Dangerous factory conditions
- Child labor widespread
- Low wages, no job security
- No workers' rights initially

### Social Classes
- **Bourgeoisie** (middle class): Factory owners, merchants, professionals
- **Proletariat** (working class): Factory workers, miners
- Growing wealth gap
- Rise of middle class values (education, respectability)

### Women and Children
- Women and children in factories (cheaper labor)
- Domestic ideology: women should be in home
- Child labor reforms (gradually)
- New jobs for women: teaching, nursing, clerical work

## Responses to Industrialization

### Reform Movements
- **Factory Acts** (Britain): Limited child labor, working hours
- **Public health reforms**: Sanitation, clean water
- **Education reforms**: Mandatory schooling
- **Labor unions**: Collective bargaining for workers

### Ideological Responses
| Ideology | Key Ideas | Thinkers |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| **Liberalism** | Free markets, individual rights, limited government | Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill |
| **Socialism** | Public ownership, workers' rights | Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels |
| **Marxism** | Class struggle, proletarian revolution, communism | Karl Marx |
| **Utopian socialism** | Ideal communities, cooperation | Robert Owen |

### Luddites
- Workers who destroyed machinery
- Feared losing jobs to machines
- Name became term for anti-technology sentiment

## The New Imperialism (1870-1914)

### Causes
- **Economic**: Raw materials, markets, investment opportunities
- **Political**: National prestige, strategic locations
- **Social**: Social Darwinism, "civilizing mission," racism
- **Technological**: Steamships, telegraphs, quinine, machine guns

### Scramble for Africa
- 1884-1885: Berlin Conference
- European powers divide Africa (without African input)
- By 1914: Only Ethiopia and Liberia independent

### Imperialism in Asia
- **India**: British Raj (formal colony after 1857 Rebellion)
- **China**: "Spheres of influence," not colonized but exploited
- **Southeast Asia**: French Indochina, Dutch East Indies, British Burma

### Forms of Imperial Control
| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Colony** | Direct rule by imperial power | British India |
| **Protectorate** | Local rulers under imperial control | Egypt |
| **Sphere of influence** | Economic dominance without formal rule | China |
| **Economic imperialism** | Control through business/investment | Latin America (U.S.) |

## Cause and Effect Relationships

### Industrialization → Imperialism
**Causes:**
- Need for raw materials (rubber, cotton, metals)
- Need for markets to sell manufactured goods
- Surplus capital seeking investment
- Technological advantages over non-industrial peoples

**Effects:**
- Colonial empires in Africa and Asia
- Exploitation of colonized peoples
- Global economic integration
- Resistance movements

### Opium Wars
**Causes:**
- British trade deficit with China
- China only accepted silver for tea
- Britain smuggled opium from India

**Effects:**
- Treaty of Nanjing (1842): Hong Kong ceded, ports opened
- Unequal treaties humiliated China
- Taiping Rebellion (internal crisis)
- Eventually → fall of Qing Dynasty

### Migration Patterns
**Causes:**
- Push: Poverty, famine (Irish Potato Famine), persecution
- Pull: Jobs in industrial cities, opportunity in Americas

**Effects:**
- Massive European emigration to Americas
- Internal migration to cities
- Multicultural societies develop
- Labor surplus keeps wages low
