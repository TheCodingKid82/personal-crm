## General Approach

### Time Management
- ~1 minute per question
- Don't spend more than 90 seconds on any question
- Mark difficult questions and come back
- Answer every question (no penalty for guessing)

### The Process
1. **Read the question first** (not the stimulus)
2. **Identify what's being asked** (comparison? causation? continuity?)
3. **Read the stimulus** with the question in mind
4. **Predict an answer** before looking at choices
5. **Eliminate wrong answers**
6. **Choose the BEST answer** (not just a correct one)

## Question Types

### Stimulus-Based Questions
Most MCQs include a stimulus: excerpt, image, map, chart, or graph.

**For text excerpts:**
- Who wrote it? When? What's their perspective?
- What's the main argument or point?
- What historical context applies?

**For images/political cartoons:**
- What symbols are used?
- What's the message or perspective?
- What historical context applies?

**For maps:**
- What region and time period?
- What patterns do you see?
- What's being shown (trade, empire, migration)?

**For charts/graphs:**
- What's being measured?
- What trends do you see?
- What time period?

### Common Question Stems

| Stem | What It's Asking |
|------|------------------|
| "Which best explains..." | Causation - why did this happen? |
| "Which most directly contributed..." | Causation - immediate cause |
| "A historian would most likely use this to..." | Source analysis |
| "Which best describes a continuity..." | What stayed the same |
| "Which best describes a change..." | What was different |
| "The excerpt best reflects..." | What idea/trend does this show |
| "Which would most directly support..." | Evidence for an argument |
| "In contrast to..." | Comparison/difference |
| "Similar to..." | Comparison/similarity |

---

## Historical Thinking Skills

### Causation
- Look for cause-and-effect relationships
- Distinguish immediate vs. long-term causes
- **Wrong answers often reverse cause/effect**

### Comparison
- Similarities AND differences
- Across regions or time periods
- **Wrong answers may be true but not comparative**

### Continuity and Change
- What stayed the same over time?
- What changed?
- **Wrong answers may describe the wrong time period**

### Contextualization
- Place events in broader historical context
- What else was happening at this time?
- **Wrong answers may mix up time periods**

## Elimination Strategies

### Automatic Eliminations
- **Too extreme**: "always," "never," "completely" (usually wrong)
- **Anachronistic**: References to things that didn't exist yet
- **Wrong region**: Answer about Europe when question is about Africa
- **Wrong time period**: 1800s answer for 1400s question
- **Reversed causation**: Effect stated as cause

### Watch Out For
- **Partially correct**: True statement but doesn't answer the question
- **True but irrelevant**: Accurate but not what's being asked
- **Correct time, wrong place**: Right period but wrong region
- **Misreading**: Read all answer choices completely

### When Stuck
- Eliminate what you can
- Look for the most historically significant answer
- Consider which theme (ENV, GOV, ECON, etc.) the question targets
- Trust your first instinct (unless you have a good reason to change)

## Common Traps

### Trap 1: The Attractive Distractor
One answer will seem obviously correct but is actually wrong.
- Usually too simple or too extreme
- Often restates the stimulus without analyzing it

### Trap 2: The Half-Truth
Answer is partially correct but missing key element.
- Read the entire answer choice
- Make sure ALL parts are accurate

### Trap 3: The Time Warp
Answer describes correct process but wrong time period.
- Always check dates
- Know your periodization

### Trap 4: The Opposite
Answer states the opposite of what's true.
- Read carefully for words like "not," "except," "least"
- Watch for negatives in the question

## Period-Specific Tips

### 1200-1450 (Units 1-2)

- Mongol Empire effects come up constantly
- Religious spread along trade routes

### 1450-1750 (Units 3-4)
- Columbian Exchange in all directions
- Compare colonial systems
- Gunpowder empires administration

### 1750-1900 (Units 5-6)

## Theme Recognition

When you see questions about:

| Topic | Likely Theme |
|-------|--------------|
| Disease, migration, agriculture | ENV |
| Religion, art, ideas spreading | CDI |
| Rulers, laws, political systems | GOV |
| Trade, labor, money | ECON |
| Class, gender, ethnicity | SIO |
| Inventions, weapons, tools | TECH |

Using theme vocabulary in your thinking helps identify correct answers.

## Practice Protocol

### Daily Practice
- Do 10-15 questions at a time
- Time yourself (about 1 min/question)
- Review ALL answer choices, even correct ones
- Understand WHY wrong answers are wrong

### Review Method
For each missed question:
1. What type of question was it?
2. What did I misunderstand?
3. What content do I need to review?
4. What trap did I fall into?

### Building Skills
- Start untimed to build accuracy
- Then add time pressure
- Track patterns in your mistakes
- Focus review on weak areas

## Quick Reference: Reading Order

1. **Question stem first** (What am I looking for?)
2. **Stimulus** (With purpose in mind)
3. **Predict answer** (Before seeing choices)
4. **Scan choices** (Look for your prediction)
5. **Eliminate** (Cross out wrong answers)
6. **Select** (Best answer, not first correct one)

---

## Test Day Tips

- Answer every question (no penalty)
- Don't change answers unless you're certain
- Mark confusing questions and return later
- Stay calm—you don't need 100% for a 5
- **55-60% correct = 5** (approximately)
