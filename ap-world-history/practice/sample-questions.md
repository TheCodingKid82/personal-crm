## Multiple Choice Questions

### Question 1 (Units 1-2)
The development of which of the following most directly enabled the expansion of trans-Saharan trade between 1200 and 1450?

A) The adoption of the camel as a pack animal
B) The spread of Christianity to West Africa
C) The development of iron smelting in West Africa
D) The decline of the Byzantine Empire

**Answer: A**

*Explanation: Camels were essential for crossing the Sahara, as they could survive long periods without water. While iron smelting (C) existed in Africa, it predates this period. Christianity (B) did not spread significantly to West Africa. The Byzantine decline (D) affected Mediterranean trade, not trans-Saharan routes.*

A) The permanent conversion of Mongol rulers to Christianity
B) The growth of trade networks connecting East Asia and the Mediterranean
C) The political unification of China under a single religious tradition
D) The spread of Buddhism to Western Europe

## Short Answer Questions

### SAQ 1 (Comparison)

a) Identify ONE similarity in how the Mongol and Ottoman empires administered diverse populations.

b) Identify ONE difference in how the Mongol and Ottoman empires administered diverse populations.

c) Explain ONE reason for the difference identified in part b.

**Model Answers:**

**a)** Both the Mongol and Ottoman empires practiced religious tolerance toward subject populations. The Mongols allowed conquered peoples to maintain their religious practices, and the Ottomans established the millet system which granted religious communities autonomy in personal matters.

**b)** The Mongols employed a meritocratic system that placed capable individuals from any background in administrative positions, while the Ottomans used the devshirme system that specifically recruited Christian boys to be trained as soldiers (Janissaries) and officials.

**c)** This difference resulted from the Ottomans' Islamic identity and their specific solution to building loyalty: by taking Christian children and converting them to Islam, the Ottomans created a class of officials with no local family ties who were entirely dependent on and loyal to the sultan, reducing the threat of hereditary nobles challenging central authority.

### SAQ 2 (Causation)

Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question.

*"Silver is used for commerce throughout the world... The Spanish conduct trade with silver, which they dig out of their mines in Peru and Mexico... This silver goes to Turkey for the products of that country; it flows into Persia in payment for its raw silks; it goes to the East Indies for spices, drugs, and curiosities."*
— Jean-Baptiste Tavernier, French traveler, 1676

a) Identify ONE way the global silver trade affected the Spanish economy according to the passage.

b) Explain ONE cause of the flow of silver from the Americas to Asia.

c) Explain ONE effect of the silver trade on China (not mentioned in the passage).

**Model Answers:**

**a)** According to the passage, silver from Spanish mines in Peru and Mexico became a global currency used for commerce throughout the world. Spain used silver to purchase goods from Turkey, Persia, and the East Indies, indicating that silver served as Spain's primary means of engaging in international trade.

**b)** Silver flowed from the Americas to Asia because Asian economies, particularly China, had high demand for silver as currency, while European merchants wanted Asian luxury goods like silk, spices, and porcelain. Since Europe produced few goods that Asian markets wanted, silver became the primary medium of exchange, creating a flow from American mines through European merchants to Asian markets.

**c)** The influx of silver transformed the Chinese economy by enabling the Ming dynasty to shift from collecting taxes in kind (grain, labor) to collecting taxes in silver. This commercialized the Chinese economy, forcing peasants to participate in markets to obtain silver for taxes, while also making China dependent on foreign silver supplies—a vulnerability exposed when silver flows decreased in the 17th century.

### SAQ 3 (Continuity and Change)

a) Identify ONE continuity in the role of religion in governance from 1450 to 1750.

b) Identify ONE change in the role of religion in governance from 1450 to 1750.

c) Explain ONE factor that caused the change identified in part b.

**Model Answers:**

**a)** Throughout this period, rulers continued to use religious authority to legitimize their political power. Ottoman sultans claimed the title of caliph to lead the Muslim world, Safavid shahs promoted Shia Islam as the state religion, and European monarchs claimed divine right to rule—all demonstrating the continued linkage of religious and political authority.

**b)** By the end of this period, some European states had moved toward greater religious tolerance and separation of religious and political authority. The Peace of Westphalia (1648) established that rulers could determine their state's religion but also provided some protections for religious minorities, representing a shift away from the religious wars of the earlier period.

**c)** The devastating Thirty Years' War (1618-1648), which killed approximately one-third of Germany's population, demonstrated the destructive potential of religious conflict. This experience led European leaders to accept the Peace of Westphalia, which prioritized political stability over religious uniformity and began the slow process of separating church and state authority in governance.

## Long Essay Questions

### LEQ Prompt 1 (Comparison)
Compare the methods used by European colonial powers to maintain control over their colonies in TWO of the following regions in the period 1750-1900:
- Africa
- Asia
- The Americas

### Outline for a Strong Response:

**Thesis:** European colonial powers in both Africa and Asia used military force and economic exploitation to maintain control, but differed in their administrative approaches, with direct rule more common in Africa and indirect rule through local elites more common in Asia, reflecting different local conditions and European capabilities.

**Contextualization:** The New Imperialism of the late 19th century was driven by the Industrial Revolution's need for raw materials and markets, as well as nationalist competition between European states. This scramble for colonies represented a new phase of European expansion following the earlier mercantile period.

**Body 1 - Similarities:**
- Both used military technology (machine guns, steamships) to conquer
- Both extracted resources for European industries
- Both imposed racial hierarchies with Europeans at top
- Evidence: British in India and French in Senegal

**Body 2 - Differences in Africa:**
- More direct rule by European officials
- Berlin Conference (1884-85) divided territory
- Borders ignored ethnic groups
- Evidence: Belgian Congo, French West Africa

**Body 3 - Differences in Asia:**
- More indirect rule through local elites
- Existing bureaucracies utilized
- British Raj used Indian civil servants
- Evidence: British India, Dutch East Indies

**Complexity:** Local resistance shaped colonial methods—where resistance was strong (like the Zulu in southern Africa), Europeans used more violent suppression, while where elites cooperated (like Indian princes), indirect rule was more feasible.

### LEQ Prompt 2 (Causation)
Evaluate the extent to which the Industrial Revolution in Britain caused changes in social structures in the period 1750-1900.

### Outline for a Strong Response:

**Thesis:** The Industrial Revolution fundamentally transformed British social structures by creating new class distinctions based on relationship to industrial production, dramatically altering gender roles, and spurring urbanization, though some traditional hierarchies persisted alongside these changes.

**Contextualization:** Before industrialization, British society was primarily agricultural and organized around landed aristocracy, with most people living in rural areas and working in agriculture or cottage industries.

**Body 1 - New class structure:**
- Rise of industrial bourgeoisie (factory owners)
- Creation of industrial proletariat (factory workers)
- Decline of traditional artisans
- Evidence: Manchester textile mills, new wealthy families

**Body 2 - Changing gender roles:**
- Women and children in factories
- Later: "separate spheres" ideology
- Middle-class women in domestic sphere
- Evidence: Factory Acts, domestic ideology

**Body 3 - Urbanization:**
- Mass migration to industrial cities
- Overcrowding, disease, social problems
- New urban culture and politics
- Evidence: London, Manchester population growth

**Complexity:** While industrialization created new social structures, traditional aristocratic power persisted well into the 19th century, with landed elites maintaining political influence in Parliament and intermarrying with new industrial wealth, demonstrating both change and continuity.

7. European intellectual defending colonization (primary, philosopher)

**Approach:**
- Group documents by motivation: economic (1, 2, 5), religious (3), political (6), intellectual justification (7)
- Thesis should acknowledge economic factors as significant BUT note other factors
- Use HIPP for docs 2 (conquistador POV) and 3 (missionary purpose)
- Outside evidence: Competition between Spain and Portugal, Treaty of Tordesillas
- Complexity: Economic and religious motivations often intertwined; "God, Gold, and Glory" worked together
