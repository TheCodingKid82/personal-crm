## How to Answer

### The Golden Rule
**Directly answer the question with a specific historical example**

### Structure for Each Part
1. **Claim** - Directly answer what's asked (1 sentence)
2. **Evidence** - Specific historical example with details (1-2 sentences)
3. **Explanation** - How the evidence supports your claim (1 sentence, if needed)

### Format Tips
- Label your answers: A, B, C (makes grading clearer)
- Write 2-4 sentences per part
- No thesis needed
- No introduction or conclusion needed
- Be specific: names, dates, places

## Common Question Types

### Type 1: Identify and Explain
> "Identify ONE way that... and explain how..."

**Approach:**
- State the specific example
- Explain the connection to the question

**Example:**
> Q: Identify ONE technological development that facilitated exploration and explain how it contributed to European overseas expansion.

> A: The caravel, a small maneuverable ship with lateen sails, enabled European exploration by allowing sailors to navigate against the wind and travel along coastlines more efficiently. This technology allowed Portuguese explorers like Vasco da Gama to reach India by sailing around Africa.

### Type 2: Compare/Contrast
> "Identify ONE similarity/difference between..."

**Approach:**
- State the similarity or difference clearly
- Provide specific evidence from both sides

**Example:**
> Q: Identify ONE similarity in how the Spanish and Portuguese established colonial economies.

> A: Both the Spanish and Portuguese colonial economies relied heavily on coerced labor systems. The Spanish used the encomienda system to force indigenous labor in silver mines and haciendas, while the Portuguese relied primarily on African slave labor on sugar plantations in Brazil.

### Type 3: Cause and Effect
> "Explain ONE cause of..." OR "Explain ONE effect of..."

**Approach:**
- Clearly state the cause or effect
- Show the connection with specific evidence

**Example:**
> Q: Explain ONE effect of the Columbian Exchange on indigenous populations in the Americas.

> A: The introduction of Eurasian diseases such as smallpox devastated indigenous American populations, who had no immunity to these diseases. It is estimated that up to 90% of the indigenous population died within the first century of contact, which made Spanish conquest easier and later necessitated the importation of African slaves to replace lost labor.

### Type 4: Continuity and Change
> "Explain ONE continuity/change in... between [period] and [period]"

**Approach:**
- Identify what stayed the same OR what changed
- Provide evidence from both time periods

**Example:**
> Q: Explain ONE change in patterns of trade between 1450 and 1750.

> A: Trade became truly global after 1450 as new transoceanic routes connected the Americas, Europe, Africa, and Asia. Before 1450, trade networks like the Silk Roads and Indian Ocean routes connected Afro-Eurasia but not the Americas. After Columbus's voyages, silver from the Americas flowed to Europe and then to China, creating the first integrated global economy.

### Type 5: Using the Stimulus
> "Using the passage, identify..." OR "Based on the image, explain..."

**Approach:**
- Reference specific details from the stimulus
- Connect to broader historical knowledge

## Scoring

Each part (A, B, C) is scored 0 or 1:

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **1** | Accurately answers the question with specific historical evidence |
| **0** | Does not answer the question, is historically inaccurate, or lacks specific evidence |

### What Earns Points
✓ Directly answering what's asked
✓ Specific historical examples (not generalizations)
✓ Accurate historical information
✓ Clear cause/effect or comparison when asked

### What Loses Points
✗ Not answering the actual question asked
✗ Vague or general statements
✗ Historical inaccuracies
✗ Discussing the wrong time period or region
✗ Missing the A, B, or C entirely

## Strategies

### Before Writing
1. Read ALL parts (A, B, C) before starting
2. Underline key terms (identify, explain, compare)
3. Note time period and region constraints
4. Quick brainstorm: what examples fit?

### While Writing
- Answer part A, then B, then C (in order)
- Be direct—first sentence should answer the question
- Include specifics: dates, names, places
- Don't overthink—you have ~3 minutes per part

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Writing a thesis (not needed)
- Starting with "I think..." or "In my opinion..."
- Being too vague ("trade increased")
- Answering a different question than what's asked
- Spending too long on one part

## Sample SAQ with Model Response

### Question (with stimulus)
**Source: Adapted from a Ming Dynasty official's report, 1580**

*"The silver that comes from overseas is used throughout the empire. All taxes and tribute are now collected in silver rather than in kind. The government mints no coins; all commerce depends on foreign silver, especially from the Spanish lands."*

A) Identify ONE way that global silver flows affected the Chinese economy as described in the passage.

B) Explain ONE cause of the flow of silver from the Americas to China.

C) Explain ONE effect of the silver trade on a region OTHER than China.

### Model Response

**A)** Silver flows transformed the Chinese tax system from payment in goods to payment in currency. As the passage indicates, "all taxes and tribute are now collected in silver," which represented a fundamental change in how the Ming government collected revenue and how Chinese peasants participated in the market economy.

**B)** Chinese demand for silver caused massive flows from the Americas because China operated on a silver standard and needed silver for its expanding commercial economy, while Europe had few goods China wanted to buy. This trade imbalance meant Spanish silver from mines at Potosí and Mexico was shipped across the Pacific via Manila to purchase Chinese silk, porcelain, and tea.

**C)** The silver trade enriched Spain but ultimately contributed to its economic decline. The massive influx of silver caused inflation (the "Price Revolution"), and Spain's reliance on silver wealth rather than developing domestic industries left it economically weakened when silver flows decreased in the 1600s.
