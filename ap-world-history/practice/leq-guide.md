## Rubric Breakdown (6 Points)

| Category | Points | What You Need |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| **Thesis** | 0-1 | Historically defensible claim that answers the prompt |
| **Contextualization** | 0-1 | Broader historical context relevant to the prompt |
| **Evidence** | 0-2 | Specific, relevant historical evidence |
| **Analysis & Reasoning** | 0-2 | Historical reasoning skill (comparison, causation, or CCOT) |

## Point-by-Point Guide

### 1. THESIS (1 point)

**What It Needs:**
- Responds to the prompt with a historically defensible claim
- Establishes a line of reasoning
- Must be in introduction or conclusion

**What It's NOT:**
- A restatement of the question
- A simple statement of fact
- A list of things you'll discuss

**Formula:**
> Although [counterargument/complexity], [your main argument] because [reason 1], [reason 2], and [reason 3].

**Examples:**

*Weak (0 points):*
> "There were many causes of the French Revolution."

*Strong (1 point):*
> "While traditional elites initially maintained power, the French Revolution fundamentally transformed European society by spreading Enlightenment ideals of popular sovereignty, inspiring nationalist movements, and demonstrating that established political orders could be overthrown by popular action."

---

### 2. CONTEXTUALIZATION (1 point)

**What It Needs:**
- Broader historical context (not just background for your argument)
- Relevant to the topic but BEFORE your thesis
- Typically 2-3 sentences minimum
- Connects the specific topic to bigger historical picture

**Good Contexts:**
- What was happening elsewhere in the world?
- What came before this that set it up?
- What broader trends or patterns was this part of?

**Where to Put It:**
- First paragraph, BEFORE thesis
- Creates a bridge from broader history to your specific argument

**Example:**
> "By the late 18th century, Enlightenment thinkers across Europe had challenged traditional ideas about government, arguing that political power derived from the consent of the governed rather than divine right. These ideas circulated through print culture and salons, reaching educated elites throughout the Atlantic world. It was in this intellectual context that revolution broke out in France in 1789, ultimately transforming not just France but political thought across the globe."

### 3. EVIDENCE (0-2 points)

| Points | Requirement |
|--------|-------------|
| 1 point | Identifies specific, relevant evidence (at least 2 examples) |
| 2 points | Uses evidence to SUPPORT an argument (not just listing) |

**What Counts as Evidence:**
- Specific events with dates
- Named individuals and their actions
- Specific policies, laws, or treaties
- Concrete examples (not generalizations)

**Specific vs. Vague:**

| Vague (0 points) | Specific (1-2 points) |
|------------------|----------------------|
| "Trade increased" | "The Atlantic slave trade transported approximately 12 million Africans to the Americas between 1500 and 1870" |
| "The ruler expanded territory" | "Suleiman the Magnificent conquered Belgrade in 1521 and besieged Vienna in 1529" |
| "New technology helped" | "The spinning jenny, invented by James Hargreaves in 1764, increased textile production" |

**Using Evidence (2 points):**
- Don't just list facts
- Explain HOW each piece of evidence supports your argument
- Connect evidence back to your thesis

---

### 4. ANALYSIS & REASONING (0-2 points)

| Points | Requirement |
|--------|-------------|
| 1 point | Uses historical reasoning (comparison, causation, or CCOT) |
| 2 points | Demonstrates COMPLEX understanding |

#### For COMPARISON essays:
- Analyze similarities AND differences
- Explain WHY similarities/differences existed
- Don't just describe each side separately

#### For CAUSATION essays:
- Analyze multiple causes OR multiple effects
- Show how causes/effects are connected
- Distinguish short-term vs. long-term

#### For CONTINUITY & CHANGE essays:
- Analyze both continuity AND change
- Explain WHY things changed or stayed the same
- Show change over time within the period

### Getting the Complexity Point:

Do ONE of these:
- Explain nuance (qualify your argument)
- Explain connections across time periods, regions, or themes
- Corroborate with diverse evidence
- Account for contradictory evidence
- Explain why your argument matters beyond the specific topic

**Example complexity moves:**
> "While the Industrial Revolution transformed economic production, traditional social hierarchies persisted as the bourgeoisie simply replaced the aristocracy at the top of the social order."

> "The spread of Islam along Indian Ocean trade routes in this period mirrors the earlier spread of Buddhism along Silk Road routes, suggesting that trade networks consistently served as vectors for religious diffusion."

## Essay Structure

### Recommended Format

**Introduction (1 paragraph)**
1. Contextualization (2-3 sentences)

## Sample LEQ with Annotations

### Prompt
> Evaluate the extent to which the Atlantic slave trade affected African societies in the period 1450-1750.

### Model Response

**[CONTEXTUALIZATION]** Before European contact, African societies had diverse political structures ranging from centralized kingdoms like Mali to decentralized societies, and participated in long-distance trade networks including the trans-Saharan routes that had operated for centuries. Slavery existed within Africa, but it was typically different from the chattel slavery that would develop in the Americas. **[THESIS]** The Atlantic slave trade fundamentally transformed African societies by redirecting trade patterns toward the coast, increasing warfare between African states competing to supply captives, and creating significant demographic impacts, though the effects varied considerably by region.

**[BODY 1 - Economic transformation]** The Atlantic slave trade reoriented African economic patterns toward the coast and toward the export of human beings. **[EVIDENCE]** Kingdoms like Dahomey in West Africa rose specifically through their participation in the slave trade, raiding neighboring peoples and exchanging captives for European firearms, textiles, and other goods. **[ANALYSIS]** This created a devastating cycle: states needed firearms to defend against raiders, but acquiring firearms required selling captives, which incentivized more raiding and warfare. **[EVIDENCE]** The Kingdom of Kongo, which had initially welcomed Portuguese missionaries and trade, was devastated by slave raiding by the 17th century, with King Afonso I writing to the Portuguese monarch complaining that merchants were "taking every day our natives." **[ANALYSIS]** This demonstrates how even African states that initially engaged with Europeans as partners became victims of the trade's dynamics.

**[BODY 2 - Political/Military transformation]** The slave trade increased warfare and transformed political structures across West and Central Africa. **[EVIDENCE]** States like Asante emerged as major powers in part through their access to European firearms obtained through slave trading. The Oyo Empire similarly expanded using cavalry and firearms obtained through trade. **[ANALYSIS]** This militarization created an environment where political power increasingly depended on the ability to conduct slave raids, fundamentally altering the nature of governance. **[EVIDENCE]** However, some regions like the interior of Africa were largely insulated from these effects, demonstrating that the trade's impact varied by geography. **[COMPLEXITY]** This pattern of European goods fueling African warfare mirrors how, in later centuries, Cold War superpowers would arm African factions, suggesting a long pattern of external interference destabilizing African political development.

**[BODY 3 - Demographic effects]** The demographic impact of the trade was substantial but difficult to quantify precisely. **[EVIDENCE]** Historians estimate that 12 million Africans were forcibly transported across the Atlantic, with millions more dying in raids or the Middle Passage. The majority of those enslaved were young men, creating gender imbalances in affected regions. **[ANALYSIS]** Some historians argue this population drain stunted economic and political development, though others note that Africa's population did eventually recover. **[COMPLEXITY]** The long-term demographic effects must also account for the introduction of American crops like maize and cassava through the Columbian Exchange, which may have offset some population losses—demonstrating the complex, sometimes contradictory effects of Atlantic connections.

**[CONCLUSION]** The Atlantic slave trade reshaped African societies economically, politically, and demographically, though the extent varied by region and time period. Coastal regions engaged in the trade experienced the most dramatic transformations, while interior regions often continued traditional patterns. The trade's legacy extended far beyond 1750, as patterns of political instability and economic extraction established during this period would continue to affect African development into the modern era.
