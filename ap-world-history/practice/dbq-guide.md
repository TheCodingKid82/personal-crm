## Point-by-Point Guide

### 1. THESIS (1 point)

Same requirements as LEQ:
- Historically defensible claim
- Responds to the prompt
- Establishes line of reasoning
- In introduction or conclusion

**Don't:** Simply restate the question or list documents.

**Example:**
> "The expansion of transoceanic trade in the period 1450-1750 was driven primarily by European desire for direct access to Asian luxury goods, enabled by new maritime technologies, and motivated by competition between European states for wealth and power."

---

### 2. CONTEXTUALIZATION (1 point)

- Broader historical context relevant to the prompt
- Goes BEYOND what the documents say
- Typically 2-3+ sentences
- Put at the beginning of your essay

**Good contextualization:**
- What came before?
- What else was happening during this period?
- What larger patterns or trends does this fit into?

---

### 3. EVIDENCE FROM DOCUMENTS (0-2 points)

| Points | Requirement |
|--------|-------------|
| 1 point | Accurately describes content of at least 3 documents |
| 2 points | Uses content from at least 6 documents to SUPPORT argument |

**Key Difference:**
- Describing = "Document 3 discusses silver trade"
- Supporting argument = "Document 3 illustrates how silver transformed economies because..."

**Tips:**
- Use 6-7 documents minimum
- Integrate documents into paragraphs (don't just list them)
- Quote briefly when helpful
- Connect each document to your thesis

**How to cite:**
> "As shown in Document 4..." OR "(Doc 4)" OR "The Spanish official's report (Document 4) reveals..."

---

### 4. EVIDENCE BEYOND DOCUMENTS (1 point)

- Bring in OUTSIDE EVIDENCE not in the documents
- Must be specific and relevant to the argument
- At least one example
- Should be as detailed as document evidence

**What counts:**
- Historical events not mentioned in documents
- Specific figures not in documents
- Treaties, laws, or policies not mentioned
- Comparable developments in other regions

**Example:**
> "Beyond the documents provided, the Portuguese establishment of trading posts along the African coast, such as Elmina in 1482, demonstrates the pattern of European commercial expansion that preceded the period discussed here."

---

### 5. SOURCING (1 point) - **HIPP**

Analyze the source of AT LEAST 2 documents using HIPP:

| Letter | Meaning | Question to Ask |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| **H** | Historical situation | What was happening when this was created? |
| **I** | Intended audience | Who was this created for? How does that affect it? |
| **P** | Purpose | Why was this created? What did the author want to achieve? |
| **P** | Point of view | What's the author's perspective? What biases might they have? |

**IMPORTANT:** Don't just identify HIPP—explain how it affects the document's meaning or reliability.

**Weak (0 points):**
> "Document 2 was written by a Spanish priest."

**Strong (1 point):**
> "Document 2, written by a Spanish priest, must be understood in the context of the Catholic Church's missionary efforts in the Americas. As a religious figure, the author's purpose was to justify colonial expansion as bringing Christianity to indigenous peoples, which may lead him to downplay the violent aspects of conquest and emphasize spiritual benefits."

**Pick documents where HIPP is easy to discuss:**
- Documents with clear biases (colonial officials, merchants)
- Documents with specific audiences (royal reports, propaganda)
- Documents reflecting specific historical moments

---

### 6. COMPLEXITY (1 point)

Do ONE of these well:

1. **Explain nuance** - Qualify or modify your argument
2. **Explain connections** - Across time, geography, or themes
3. **Analyze contradictions** - Use evidence that challenges your thesis and explain it
4. **Multiple perspectives** - Show how different groups experienced the topic differently

**This is the hardest point.** Aim for it, but don't sacrifice other points chasing it.

**Examples of complexity:**
> "While European merchants benefited enormously from the silver trade, the effects were complex: Spanish economies suffered from inflation, while Chinese economies became dependent on foreign silver supplies."

> "The documents reveal that responses to imperialism varied significantly: while Document 3 shows armed resistance, Document 6 demonstrates accommodation, suggesting that colonized peoples employed multiple strategies depending on their circumstances."

## Document Analysis Strategy

### During Reading Period (15 minutes)

**Step 1: Read the prompt carefully (1 min)**
- What is the question asking?
- What time period?
- What skill (causation, comparison, CCOT)?

**Step 2: Read and annotate documents (10 min)**
For each document, note:
- Main point (1-2 words)
- How it relates to prompt
- Possible HIPP analysis
- Group it belongs to (thematic grouping)

**Step 3: Plan your essay (4 min)**
- Group documents by theme (2-3 groups)
- Write thesis
- Note outside evidence to include
- Decide which 2+ documents to HIPP

### Document Grouping

Group documents by argument, not just topic:

**Example groupings for trade question:**
- Group 1: Economic motivations (Docs 1, 3, 6)
- Group 2: Political/strategic motivations (Docs 2, 5)
- Group 3: Effects/consequences (Docs 4, 7)

## Essay Structure

### Introduction
1. Contextualization (3-4 sentences)
2. Thesis (1-2 sentences)

### Body Paragraphs (2-3)
Each paragraph:
1. Topic sentence (your argument for this group)
2. Document 1 with explanation + support for thesis
3. HIPP analysis for one document (if doing here)
4. Document 2 with explanation + support
5. Document 3 (if applicable)
6. Outside evidence (weave in where relevant)
7. Connection back to thesis

### Conclusion
1. Restate thesis
2. Complexity move (if not done in body)

## Time Management

| Task | Time |
|------|------|
| Reading period | 15 minutes |
| Write introduction | 5 minutes |
| Body paragraph 1 | 12 minutes |
| Body paragraph 2 | 12 minutes |
| Body paragraph 3 (if time) | 10 minutes |
| Conclusion | 3-5 minutes |
| Review | 2-3 minutes |

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Not using enough documents
- **Fix:** Use 6-7 documents, mention each by number

### Mistake 2: Listing documents instead of using them
- **Fix:** Explain HOW each document supports your argument

### Mistake 3: HIPP without explanation
- **Fix:** Always explain why the HIPP matters for interpretation

### Mistake 4: Forgetting outside evidence
- **Fix:** Plan one specific example before writing

### Mistake 5: No clear grouping
- **Fix:** Organize documents thematically, not document-by-document

### Mistake 6: Running out of time
- **Fix:** Keep to time limits; a complete essay beats a perfect one

## HIPP Examples by Document Type
